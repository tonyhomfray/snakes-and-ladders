## Buttons:
    Only show Hide / Take Turn buttons are appropriate time
    Restart button at end of Game
### SOLUTION
        Single button shown at one time
        Default to Start button in HTML for now
            This will change when adding the option to choose number and names of players
        Have a Button div
        Use JS to change the button as required
        Have button definitions in the JS
### IMPLEMENTATION
        Add JS button definitions
        Add function() to change the button with parameter to define which button
        Add function calls to appropriate points of the code
            startGame() >> change to Take Turn
            endGame() >> change to Restart
